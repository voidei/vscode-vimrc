# VSCode Syntax Highlighting for `.vimrc` Files

Syntax highlighting for `.vimrc` files, without needing to download the full [**Vim**](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) extension.

If you have the `VSCode Vim` extension already, there's no reason for you to have this one.
The language configurations are taken directory from the `VSCode Vim` extension,
so you'll simply be using two extensions to do the same thing.
